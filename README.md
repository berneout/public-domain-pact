# What?

A form pact to dedicate copyright in software to the public domain.

# Who?

The pact is a contract with a (fictional) corporation, Berneout Alliance, Inc. Berneout Alliance hypothetically runs a website with the following features:

1. Allows members to upload releases of software.

2. Has the uploading member answer a provenance questionnaire about the release after it is uploaded.

3. Summons other developers mentioned on the provenance questionnaire to answer provenance questionnaires about their contributions to the release.

4. When all mentioned have signed off, publishes the release to the Internet, by project name and in an index of tarball and individual file hash to release record, with a highly permissive license from Berneout Alliance, Inc. itself.

5. If and when true, irrevocable, accountable dedication to the public domain becomes possible under California and United States federal law, Berneout Alliance, Inc. has prior permission to dedicate copyright in the releases to the public domain in bulk.

# Why?

For various legal reasons, it is very hard to make a truly irrevocable disclaimer of all copyright. Even if that were possible, open source projects as a rule don't even track provenance information, meaning that copyrights purportedly "dedicated to the public domain" may actually belong to someone else, like an employer.
